\underline{\textbf{\Large{Projects}}}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\underline{\textbf{\large{Project Hastha:}}}\\ 
		This is a product, which our team built for the \textbf{"Smart India Hackathon-2017"},competition. We built a\\ smart glove which assists the deaf and dumb to communicate with the world by converting hand gestures to\\ voice via an android app. It will also assist the visually impaired to control home appliances by hand gestures.\\We were the \textbf{2nd runner ups} of this competition.}
	\item{\underline{\textbf{\large{TrailBlazer:}}}\\
		This is a competition conducted by NITK-2016 where we had to build a line following robot which can collect some information available on the arena, analyse it and then display suitable answer when the finish point is reached.We were the \textbf{Winners} of this competition. }
	\item{\underline{\textbf{\large{Cross the Crator:}}}\\ This is the theme which our team worked on, for the \textbf{eYantra Robotics Challenge-2016-17} held at IITB.The Firebird V robot had to navigate appropriate bridge by crossing the crators on its way by using image processing and path planning algorithms.We were the \textbf{Finalists} of this event.  }
	\item{\underline{\textbf{\large{Voice Recognition System:}}}\\This is a project done by our team in Matlab using \textbf{Digital signal processing} which can recognize the speaker by his/her voice provided it is trained prior.This was done from security point of view. }
	\item{\underline{\textbf{\large{LED matrix:}}} \\This is a visually appealing cube built out of LEDs which glow in certain pattern. When the music is played, they appear like dancing LEDs.This was my 1st year project done to understand microcontrollers. }
	\item{\underline{\textbf{\large{NCSC:}}} \\National Children's Science Congress, a survey and research based competition held by Government of India for High School students keeping environmental issues in mind.We were the \textbf{Zonal winners} in the year 2012 for the topic \textbf{"Soil- Use for prosperity,Save for posterity".}}
